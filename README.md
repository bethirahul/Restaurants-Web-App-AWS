# My Restaurants' Catalogue (App) - Amazon Web Services

Application link: http://52.40.101.245.xip.io/restaurants_catalogue

This project is the extension of my existing project - [**My Restaurants' Catalogue**](https://github.com/bethirahul/Restaurant-Web-app).
Built by _**Rahul Bethi**_.

It is a **Web application** hosted on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) [LightSail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) Ubuntu instance. It has a web server (Apache 2) with a database (PostgreSQL) to store and edit information about **Restaurants** and the **food items** sold in them.
It also has a user system with [_Google_](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2) and [_Facebook_](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login) - [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication to login and make modifications (CRUD operations) to _add_, _edit_ or _delete_ restaurants and their items.

It also has a JSON endpoint to provide restaurant details and item details.

## Built using

1. [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) v3.5.2 - [**Flask**](http://flask.pocoo.org/) v0.12.2 (_micro-framework_), [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) v1.2.6, [OAuth2client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauth2client) v4.1.2
2. [**Apache**](https://httpd.apache.org/) v2.4.18 web server
    - [mod_wsgi](https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) v4.3.0 package
3. [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) v9.5.12 database server
4. [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/) linux operating system
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) with key pairs, [Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html)
5. [**Amazon Web Services**](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) - [LightSail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) virtual machine instance on AWS Cloud
    - Lower configuration than a AWS EC2 _t2-micro_ instance (512MB RAM), cheaper pricing and free tier.
    - Hosted at [**52.40.101.245**.xip.io](http://52.40.101.245.xip.io)
6. [**Google**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2), [**Facebook**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login) - [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication systems
7. HTML, CSS
8. Other tools used while developing (not needed to build the app again):
    - [**Vagrant**](https://www.vagrantup.com/) v2.0.3 virtual machine - identical to AWS instance
        - Used to test and debug the app in the local machine, before setting the app on AWS Cloud.
    - Windows 10 PC, Visual Studio Code
    - [Git-bash](https://git-scm.com/) to access AWS LightSail instance, [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Instructions to run

### Setup system

1. Get an [**AWS** account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) (free tier) and create a [**LightSail**](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/home/instances) instance with '_OS only (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)_' option.
2. Create a _Static IP address_ from [AWS LightSail console] -> [Networking] and attach it to the instance created.
3. Open the instance from the [AWS LightSail console] (opens in browser) or by SSH into the instance by using username ``ubuntu``, instance's IP address and SSH private key location.
    - _AWS default SSH key_ can be obtained from [AWS LightSail console] -> [Account] -> [SSH Keys].
4. Create a **new user** and add ``sudo`` permission.
    - New user: ``sudo useradd <new_user>``
    - Add sudo permission by adding an entry in a _new file_ at ``/etc/sudoers.d/<new_user>``
        ```conf
        <new_user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
        ```
    - Create a new **SSH key pair** by running ``ssh-keygen`` on the local machine.
    - Copy the SSH public key into new user's ``/home/<new_user>/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file in the AWS instance.
        - Create the directory and file if they don't exist.
    - Change file permissions and ownership on the ``authorized_keys`` file and ``.ssh`` directory.
        ```bash
        sudo chmod 600 /home/<new_user>/.ssh/authorized_keys
        sudo chmod 700 /home/<new_user>/.ssh
        sudo chown <new_user> /home/<new_user>/.ssh/authorized_keys
        sudo chown <new_user> /home/<new_user>/.ssh
        sudo chgrp <new_user> /home/<new_user>/.ssh/authorized_keys
        sudo chgrp <new_user> /home/<new_user>/.ssh
        ```
    - Now, this user on AWS instance can log in from this local machine using the username, IP address of the instance and the SSH private key on the local machine.
        ```bash
        ssh <new_user>@<ip_address-or-domain> -p <ssh_port> -i /private/key/location/with/file
        ```
5. Close and login with the new user.
6. Update the system.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```
7. Install **Finger** to check more details about a user
    - Install: ``sudo apt-get finger``
    - Current user info: ``finger``
    - User info (detailed): ``finger <user>``
8. Modify SSH configuration file ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config``
    - Disable _Login-by-password_ by changing ``PasswordAuthentication`` to ``no``
    - Change **SSH port**
        - First Allow AWS LightSail instance's Firewall to allow/deny the desired ports ``AWS LightSail console -> Instance -> Networking -> Firewall``.
        - Change ``Port`` to your desired port number in the configuration file.
    - Restart SSH ``sudo service sshd restart``
9. Configure **Uncomplicated FireWall** (UFW) to allow SSH (new port), HTTP(80) and NTP(123) ports.
    - Check status: ``sudo ufw status``
    - Deny all incoming: ``sudo ufw default deny incoming``
    - Allow all outgoing: ``sudo ufw default allow outgoing``
    - Allow port: ``sudo ufw allow <port#>``
    - Allow port on TCP or UDP: ``sudo ufw allow <port#>/<tcp-or-udp>``
    - Allow changed SSH port and NTP using their port numbers as shown above.
    - HTTP can also be allowed by using names ``www`` or ``http``
        - ``sudo ufw allow www`` or ``sudo ufw allow http``
10. Configure the local time-zone to UTC.
    - Run ``sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata``
    - Then select [None of the above] -> [UTC]

### Install softwares

1. **Python 3.5.2** comes pre-installed on this instance, but not **Pip**. Pip is used to get python packages.
    - Install Pip: ``sudo apt-get install python3-pip``
2. Install Python packages
    - ``pip3 install flask`` --> Flask _(micro-framework)_
    - ``pip3 install sqlalchemy`` --> SQL toolkit
    - ``pip3 install oauth2client`` --> OAuth 2.0 client library
    - ``pip3 install psycopg2`` --> PostgreSQL database adapter



3. Setup Database:
    - _Skip this step and delete [``restaurantmenuwithusers.db``](/restaurantmenuwithusers.db) file if you want to use my database setup_
    - Run [``database_setup.py``](/database_setup.py) using Python to setup Database
    - Run [``initiating_db_with_users.py``](/initiating_db_with_users.py) using Python to populate the database with values.
        - _You can modify this file with your own values._
4. Run [``flask_app.py``](/flask_app.py) using Python, the app will be up and running on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) address. Press **Ctrl**+**C** a few times to stop the server.
5. To be able to use Google and Facebook OAuth 2.0 Authentication, App ID and Client Secret are needed from each of the providers.
    - For Google - Create App Credentials at [Google's Developers webpage](https://console.developers.google.com) and download the clients secret JSON file into the project. Rename it to ``client_secrets.json``.
        - A Mockup of the client secrets json file is already present with other credentials in it [``client_secrets.json``](/client_secrets.json). GO through it to setup credentials at google and replace it with your own ``client_secrets.json`` file.
    - For Facebook - Goto [Facebook's Developers webpage](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create AppCredentials. Copy the App ID and App Secret into the [``fb_client_secrets.json``](/fb_client_secrets.json) file.
6. There are two type of JSON endpoints for restaurants.
    - [``/restaurants/json``](http://localhost:8000/restaurants/json) - for all restaurnts' _name_, _ID_ and _creater ID_
    - ``/restaurants/``_\<``Restaurant ID``>_``/json`` - for each restaruant's items

## Design

1. [``database_setup.py``](/database_setup.py) uses SQLAlchemy library to setup database and tables inside it.
    - It has classes for tables and Columns in each table.
    - Serialize function in each class to return items in easily readable format - to convert to json.
    - Menu Item class also has time variable which stores the time when the item is created. This is used to sort the latest added items.

2. [``initiating_db_with_users.py``](/initiating_db_with_users.py) is used to populate the empty database which was created.

3. The server code [``flask_app.py``](/flask_app.py) is the main program.
    - It handles all the requests from the client, including Google and Facebook _OAuth 2.0_ Authentication.
        - Files [``client_secret.json``](/client_secret.json) for Google and [``initiating_db_with_users.py``](/initiating_db_with_users.py) for Facebook are used get the App ID and Client Secret for respective providers.
        - A Random string is generated and used to send and receive as state_token to avoid _Cross-site Reference Forgery attacks_.
        - When a user log-in for the first time, A new entry is created in the database by getting the details of user's _name_, _profile picture_, _email_ and _ID_.
        - A returning user is identified using his _email_ address.

    - It also handles _CRUD operations_ (using SQLAlchemy) on the database which we created, based on the requests we get from client.
    - Two _Methods_ are supported, GET and POST as HTML5 only supports these two.
        - All links are accessed through GET method, only CRUD operations and login pages use POST method to submit the requests.

    - Flask framework is used to _handle requests_, send _**Flash messages**_ for errors, and render _**Dynamic HTML webpages**_.
        - The HTML templates are located in [templates](/templates) folder.
        - CSS style sheet [``styles.css``](/static/styles.css) is located in [static](/ststic) folder

    - And at last the web server is run on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) address.

_Please read through the detailed code comments in [``flask_app.py``](/flask_app.py) to know how the app is built._

**Screenshots** of all the pages are located in [Screenshots](/Screenshots) folder.
